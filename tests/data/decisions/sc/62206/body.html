    <p><strong>BERSAMIN, J.:</strong></p>

    <p></p><div align="JUSTIFY">Being now assailed in this appeal are the decision promulgated by the Court of Appeals (CA) on November 22, 2002 (dismissing the petitioner's petition for <i>certiorari</i> for not being the proper remedy, thereby affirming the dismissal of Civil Case No. 12558 by the trial court on the ground of the valuation by the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) having already become final due to her failure as the landowner to bring her action for judicial determination of just compensation within 15 days from notice of such valuation),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> and the resolution promulgated on June 2, 2003 (denying her motion for reconsideration).<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[2]</sup><br><br><center><b>Antecedents</b><br></center><br>The petitioner was the registered owner of agricultural lands with a total area of 19.6843 hectares situated in Villegas, Guihulngan, Negros Oriental and covered by Original Certificate of Title No. (OCT) FV-34400, OCT No. 34401, OCT No. 34402, and OCT No. 34403, all of the Register of Deeds of Negros Oriental. For purposes of placing those lands within the coverage of Republic Act No. 6657 (R.A. No, 6657),<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> the Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board (DARAB), Office of the Provincial Adjudicator, in Dumaguete City sent to her in 1998 several Notices of Land Valuation and Acquisition by which her lands were valued for acquisition by the DAR as follows:<br><blockquote><table width="100%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tbody><tr><td width="15%">1.

Her complaint, docketed as Civil Case No. 12558, prayed that the DARAB valuation be set aside and declared null and void, and that in its stead the price of her lands be fixed based on the fair market value thereof.<br><br>After filing their answer, the respondents filed a manifestation and motion to dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> stating that the petitioner's failure to timely appeal the May 28, 1999 DARAB order had rendered the order final and executory pursuant to Section 51<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> of R.A. No. 6657. They attached to the motion to dismiss a June 23, 2000 certification of finality issued by the Clerk of the DARAB,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> stating that the May 28, 1999 order had become final and executory because there had been no appeal filed within the reglementary period provided by law.<br><br>In her opposition to the respondents' motion to dismiss,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup> the petitioner admitted that Civil Case No, 12558 was filed beyond the reglementary period, but insisted that the RTC sitting as special agrarian court (SAC) was not barred from acquiring jurisdiction over the complaint for determination of just compensation, because her cause of action was anchored on the respondents' violation of her right to due process and their taking of her property without just compensation due to the DARAB valuation being too low and having been arbitrarily arrived at. She claimed that the RTC as the SAC should accord her the same treatment it had accorded to other landowners who had been given the chance to be heard on their claim for re-valuation despite the belated filing of their complaints for just compensation.<br><br>On June 7, 2001, the RTC as the SAC granted the respondents' motion to dismiss.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> Citing Section 51 and Section 54<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> of R.A.

It dismissed her argument that the case was anchored on violations of her constitutional rights to due process and just compensation, declaring that the controlling ruling was <i>Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup> not <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> Thus, applying the ruling in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i>, the RTC concluded that dismissal was proper because she had filed Civil Case No. 12558 beyond the statutory 15-day period.<br><br>The petitioner moved for reconsideration,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> but to no avail.<br><br>Thus, on October 22, 2001, the petitioner brought her petition for <i>certiorari</i> in the CA assailing the dismissal of Civil Case No. 12558.<br><br>On November 22, 2002, the CA rendered its decision affirming the dismissal of Civil Case No. 12558, opining that because the June 7, 2001 order of the RTC dismissing Civil Case No. 12558 was a final order, the petitioner's remedy was not the special civil action for <i>certiorari</i> but an appeal in the CA; that she chose the wrong remedy because <i>certiorari</i> could not take the place of an appeal; and that the RTC thus committed no grave abuse of discretion that warranted the issuance of the writ of <i>certiorari</i>.<br><br><center><b>Issue</b><br></center><br>The petitioner raises the following issue for resolution:<br><blockquote>WHETHER OR NOT ON THE QUESTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO EQUAL PROTECTION OF LAW, THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION DATED NOVEMBER 22, 2002 RULING THAT THE PETITION FOR <i>CERTIORARI</i> WAS NOT THE PROPER REMEDY IS CONTRARY TO THE LAW AND JURISPRUDENCE AS APPLIED TO THE EVIDENCE ON RECORD.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup><br></blockquote>The petitioner argues that she is entitled to equal protection and treatment accorded by the very same trial court to other landowners whose landholdings were placed under agrarian reform coverage, listing the cases involving other landowners who had been given the chance to be heard on their claim for re-valuation by the trial court.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> She justifies her resort to <i>certiorari</i> by claiming that the RTC, in dismissing Civil Case No. 12558, acted whimsically and arbitrarily, and gravely abused its discretion; and that <i>certiorari</i> was necessary to prevent irreparable damage and injury to her resulting from the acquisition by the State of her lands based on wrongful valuation and without paying her the proper and just compensation.<br><br>In their respective comments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> the respondents counter that the petitioner's reliance on the equal protection clause of the fundamental law is misplaced and bereft of legal and factual basis; that, on the contrary, they faithfully performed their task in relation to her landholdings, and in accordance with the agrarian laws and guidelines issued in furtherance thereof; that the final and executory DARAB valuation should no longer be disturbed by her frivolous claim of lack of due process; that her failure to properly observe the rules of procedure relative to reglementary periods should not be concealed by a trivial claim of violation of her constitutional rights; that pursuant to Section 60<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> of RA 6657, the decision became final because an appeal by petition for review was not taken from the decision of the RTC as the SAC within 15 days from notice of the decision; and that there was no proof of service on the CA of a copy of the petition as required by Section 3, Rule 45 of the <i>Rules of Court</i> and Circular No, 19-91, thereby warranting the outright dismissal of the petition.<br><br><center><b>Ruling of the Court</b><br></center><br>The petition for review is meritorious.<br><br><center><b>I<br><br><i>Certiorari</i> was a proper remedy despite the availability of appeal</b><br></center><br>The CA ruled that the proper remedy of the petitioner was not to bring the petition for <i>certiorari</i> but to appeal the dismissal of Civil Case No. 12558 in accordance with the <i>Rules of Court</i>; and that appeal as her proper remedy was already time-barred.<br><br>Ostensibly, the assailed dismissal by the RTC was an order that had finally disposed of Civil Case No. 12558; hence, the petitioner's proper recourse therefrom was an appeal taken in due course because the order of dismissal was a final disposition of the case.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup> In that situation, <i>certiorari</i> would not have been appropriate.<br><br>However, the petitioner would not be prevented from assailing the dismissal by petition for <i>certiorari</i> provided her resort complied with the requirements of the <i>Rules of Court</i> for the bringing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i>. In that regard, the following requisites must concur for <i>certiorari</i> to prosper, namely: (1) the writ is directed against a tribunal, a board or any officer exercising judicial or quasi-judicial functions; (2) such tribunal, board or officer has acted without or in excess of jurisdiction, or with grave abuse of discretion amounting to lack or excess of jurisdiction; and (3) there is no appeal or any plain, speedy and adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> <i>Without jurisdiction</i> means that the court acted with absolute lack of authority. There is <i>excess of jurisdiction</i> when the court transcends its power or acts without any statutory authority, <i>Grave abuse of discretion</i> implies such capricious and whimsical exercise of judgment as to be equivalent to lack or excess of jurisdiction; in other words, power - is exercised in an arbitrary or despotic manner by reason of passion, prejudice, or personal hostility; and such exercise is so patent or so gross as to amount to an evasion of a positive duty or to a virtual refusal either to perform the duty enjoined or to act at all in contemplation of law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup><br><br>Indeed, the Court has held that the availability of an appeal as a remedy is a bar to the bringing of the petition for <i>certiorari</i> only where such appeal is in itself a sufficient and adequate remedy, in that it will promptly relieve the petitioner from the injurious effects of the judgment or final order complained of.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> The Court does not hesitate or halt on its tracks in granting the writ of <i>certiorari</i> to prevent irreparable damage and injury to a party in cases where the trial judge capriciously and whimsically exercised his judgment, or where there may be a failure of justice;<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> or where the assailed order is a patent nullity; or where the grant of the writ of <i>certiorari</i> will arrest future litigations; or for certain considerations, such as public welfare and public policy.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup><br><br>Here, the petitioner laments that she had not been accorded equal protection and treatment by the trial court which had awarded to other landowners a higher valuation of their property despite the belated filing of their petitions. For sure, the petition for <i>certiorari</i> thereby plainly alleged that the RTC had committed grave abuse of discretion by violating the petitioner's constitutional right to due process or equal protection. Such a petition should not be forthwith dismissed but should be fully heard if only to ascertain and determine if the very serious allegations were true.<br><br><center><b>II <br><br>Dismissal of petitioner's action was unfair and improper</b><br></center><br>Section 9, Article III of the 1987 Constitution provides that "[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation." The determination of just compensation has been the subject of various discordant rulings of the Court. Although some of the later rulings have supposedly settled the controversy of whether the courts or the DAR should have the final say on just compensation, the conflict has continued, and has caused some confusion to the Bench and the Bar, as well as to the other stakeholders in the expropriation of agricultural landholdings.<br><br>Under existing law and regulation, respondent LBP is tasked with the responsibility of initially determining the value of lands placed under land reform and the just compensation to be paid the landowners for their taking.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> By way of notice sent to the landowner pursuant to Section 16(a)<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> of R.A. No. 6657, the DAR makes an offer to acquire the land sought to be placed under agrarian reform. If the concerned landowner rejects the offer, a summary administrative proceeding is held, and thereafter the provincial adjudicator (PARAD), the regional adjudicator (RARAD) or the central adjudicator (DARAB), as the case may be, fixes the price to be paid for the land, based on the various factors and criteria as determined by law or regulation. Should the landowner disagree with the valuation, he/she may bring the matter to the RTC acting as the SAC.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> This is the procedure for the determination of just compensation under R.A. No, 6657.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup><br><br>There appears to be no question on the respondents' observance of the proper procedure for acquisition of the petitioner's lands. The remaining issue concerns whether the trial court's dismissal of her petition because of her failure to file it before the decision/order of the DARAB became final and executory pursuant to Section 51 of R.A. No. 6657 was fair and proper.<br><br>We rule in the negative.<br><br>There have been divergent rulings on whether the courts or another agency of the government could address the determination of just compensation in eminent domain, but the starting point is the landmark 1987 ruling in <i>Export Processing Zone Authority (EPZA) v. Dulay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup> which resolved the challenge against several decrees promulgated by President Marcos. The decrees provided certain measures to the effect that the just compensation for property under expropriation should be either the assessment of the property by the Government or the sworn valuation of the property by the owner, whichever was <i>lower</i>. In declaring the decrees unconstitutional, the Court cogently held:<br><blockquote>The method of ascertaining just compensation under the aforecited decrees constitutes impermissible encroachment on judicial prerogatives. It tends to render this Court inutile in a matter which under this Constitution is reserved to it for final determination.<br><br>Thus, although in an expropriation proceeding the court technically would still have the power to determine the just compensation for the property, following the applicable decrees, its task would be relegated to simply stating the lower value of the property as declared either by the owner or the assessor. As a necessary consequence, it would be useless for the court to appoint commissioners under Rule 67 of the Rules of Court. Moreover, the need to satisfy the due process clause in the taking of private property is seemingly fulfilled since it cannot be said that a judicial proceeding was not had before the actual taking. However, the strict application of the decrees during the proceedings would be nothing short of a mere formality or charade as the court has only to choose between the valuation of the owner and that of the assessor, and its choice is always limited to the lower of the two. The court cannot exercise its discretion or independence in determining what is just and fair. Even a grade school pupil could substitute for the judge insofar as the determination of constitutional just compensation is concerned.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>In the present petition, we are once again confronted with the same question of whether the courts under P.D. No. 1533, which contains the same provision on just compensation as its predecessor decrees, still have the power and authority to determine just compensation, independent of what is stated by the decree and to this effect, to appoint commissioners for such purpose.<br><br>This time we answer in the affirmative.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>It is violative of due process to deny the owner the opportunity to prove that the valuation in the tax documents is unfair or wrong. And it is repulsive to the basic concepts of justice and fairness to allow the haphazard work of a minor bureaucrat or clerk to absolutely prevail over the judgment of a court promulgated only after expert commissioners have actually viewed the property, after evidence and arguments pro and con have been presented, and after all factors and considerations essential to a fair and just determination have been judiciously evaluated.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup><br></blockquote>The Court has reiterated <i>EPZA v. Dulay</i> in its later decisions, stressing that such determination was the function of the courts of justice that no other branch or official of the Government could usurp.<br><br>Upon the effectivity of R.A. No. 6657 in 1988, the DAR, as the central implementing agency of the law, promulgated the DARAB Rules of Procedures in 1989, 1994, 2003, and 2009 pursuant to the provisions of Section 49<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> and Section 50<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup> of R.A. No. 6657 vesting it with the power to issue rules and regulations, whether substantive or procedural, to carry out the objects and purposes of the CARL, Moreover, Section 57 of the CARL defines the jurisdiction of the RTC sitting as the SAC, <i>viz</i>.:<br><blockquote>Section 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction</i> - The Special Agrarian Courts shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts unless modified by this Act.<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision.<br></blockquote><i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> which was principally relied upon by the petitioner herein, reiterated that the determination of just compensation for the taking of lands under the CARL was a power vested in the courts and not in administrative agencies, clarifying that the jurisdiction of the SAC was not appellate but original and exclusive, to wit:<br><blockquote>Apart from the fact that only a statute can confer jurisdiction on courts and administrative agencies — rules of procedure cannot — it is noteworthy that the New Rules of Procedure of the DARAB, which was adopted on May 30, 1994, now provide that in the event a landowner is not satisfied with a decision of an agrarian adjudicator, the landowner can bring the matter directly to the Regional Trial Court sitting as Special Agrarian Court. Thus Rule XIII, §11 of the new rules provides:<br><blockquote>§11. <i>Land Valuation and Preliminary Determination and Payment of Just Compensation</i>. - The decision of the Adjudicator on land valuation and preliminary determination and payment of just compensation shall not be appealable to the Board but shall be brought directly to the Regional Trial Courts designated as Special Agrarian Courts within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice thereof. Any party shall be entitled to only one motion for reconsideration.<br></blockquote>This is an acknowledgment by the DARAB that the decision of just compensation cases for the taking of lands under R.A. No. 6657 is a power vested in the courts.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>xxx. In accordance with it, the private respondent's case was properly brought by it in the RTC, and it was error for the latter court to have dismissed the case. In the terminology of §57, the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has "original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners." It would subvert this "original and exclusive" jurisdiction of the RTC for the DAR to vest original jurisdiction in compensation cases in administrative officials and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions.<br><br>Consequently, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from §57 that the <i>original</i> and <i>exclusive</i> jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to §57 and therefore would be void. What adjudicators are empowered to do is only to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation to be paid to landowners, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br></blockquote>In the January 18, 2000 ruling in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> the Court, through Justice Vicente V. Mendoza who had penned <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>, upheld the DARAB rule to the effect that the adjudicator's preliminary determination of just compensation must be brought to the SAC within 15 days from receipt of the notice thereof; otherwise, the parties would be concluded by the result. The Court then declared:<br><blockquote>As we held in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i>, this rule is an acknowledgment by the DARAB that the power to decide just compensation cases for the taking of lands under R.A. No, 6657 is vested in the courts. It is error to think that, because of Rule XIII, §11, the original and exclusive jurisdiction given to the courts to decide petitions for determination of just compensation has thereby been transformed into an appellate jurisdiction. It only means that, in accordance with settled principles of administrative law, primary jurisdiction is vested in the DAR as an administrative agency to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation to be paid for the lands taken under the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program, but such determination is subject to challenge in the courts.<br><br>The jurisdiction of the Regional Trial Courts is not any less "original and exclusive" because the question is first passed upon by the DAR, as the judicial proceedings are not a continuation of the administrative determination. For that matter, the law may provide that the decision of the DAR is final and unappealable. Nevertheless, resort to the courts cannot be foreclosed on the theory that courts are the guarantors of the legality of administrative action.<br><br>Accordingly, as the petition in the Regional Trial Court was filed beyond the 15-day period provided in Rule XIII, §11 of the Rules of Procedure of the DARAB, the trial court correctly dismissed the case and the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the order of dismissal.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>However, in the 2007 ruling in <i>Land Bank v. Suntay</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[43]</sup> the Court opined that the RTC erred in dismissing the Land Bank's petition for determination of just compensation on the ground that it was filed beyond the 15-day period provided in Section 11, Rule XIII of the DARAB New Rules of Procedure. This Court then emphatically reminded that the SAC's jurisdiction over petitions for the determination of just compensation was original and exclusive; that any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators of the DARAB and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTC into appellate jurisdiction was void for being contrary to R.A, No. 6657; and that what DARAB adjudicators were empowered to do was only to determine <i>in a preliminary manner</i> the reasonable compensation to be paid to the landowners, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this question.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[44]</sup><br><br>To purge any uncertainties brought about by the conflicting jurisprudence on the matter, this Court held in its July 31, 2008 resolution in <i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[45]</sup><br><blockquote>On the supposedly conflicting pronouncements in the cited decisions, the Court reiterates its ruling in this case that <b><i>the agrarian reform adjudicator's decision on land valuation attains finality after the lapse of the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules</i>. The petition for the fixing of just compensation should therefore, following the law and settled jurisprudence, be filed with the SAC within the said period.</b> This conclusion, as already explained in the assailed decision, is based on the doctrines laid down in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank v. Court of Appeals</i> and <i>Department of Agrarian Reform Adjudication Board v. Lubrica</i>.<br><br>xxxx<br><br>The Court notes that the Suntay ruling is based on <i>Republic of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>, decided in 1996 also through the pen of Justice Vicente V. Mendoza. In that case, the Court emphasized that the jurisdiction of the SAC is original and exclusive, not appellate. <i>Republic</i>, however, was decided at a time when Rule XIII, Section 11 was not yet present in the DARAB Rules. Further, <i>Republic</i> did not discuss whether the petition filed therein for the fixing of just compensation was filed out of time or not. The Court merely decided the issue of whether cases involving just compensation should first be appealed to the DARAB before the landowner can resort to the SAC under Section 57 of R.A. No. 6657.<br><br>To resolve the conflict in the rulings of the Court, we now declare herein, for the guidance of the bench and the bar, that the better rule is that stated in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i>, reiterated in <i>Lubrica</i> and in the August 14, 2007 Decision in this case. Thus, <b><i>while a petition for the fixing of just compensation with the SAC is not an appeal from the agrarian reform adjudicator's decision but an original action, the same has to be filed within the 15-day period stated in the DARAB Rules; otherwise, the adjudicator's decision will attain finality</i></b>. This rule is not only in accord with law and settled jurisprudence but also with the principles of justice and equity. Verily, a belated petition before the SAC, <i>e.g.</i>, one filed a month, or a year, or even a decade after the land valuation of the DAR adjudicator, must not leave the dispossessed landowner in a state of uncertainty as to the true value of his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[46]</sup> (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>In all of the foregoing rulings of the Court as well as in subsequent ones, it could not have been overemphasized that the determination of just compensation in eminent domain is a judicial function. However, the more recent jurisprudence uphold the preeminence of the pronouncement in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i> to the effect that the parties only have 15 days from their receipt of the decision/order of the DAR within which to invoke the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC; otherwise, the decision/order attains finality and immutability.<br><br>It remains uncontested that the petitioner filed her complaint in the RTC for the determination of just compensation after more than two and a half months had already elapsed from the time the DARAB issued the assailed valuation. Following the pronouncement in <i>Philippine Veterans Banks</i>, her failure to file the complaint within the prescribed 15-day period from notice would have surely rendered the DARAB's valuation order final and executory. As such, it would seem that there was sufficient ground for the dismissal of the petitioner's complaint for having been filed out of time.<br><br>However, we cannot fairly and properly hold that the petitioner's complaint for the determination of just compensation should be barred from being tried and decided on that basis. The prevailing rule at the time she filed her complaint on August 19, 1999 was that enunciated in <i>Republic v. Court of Appeals</i> on October 30, 1996.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[47]</sup> The pronouncement in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i> was promulgated on January 18, 2000 when the trial was already in progress in the RTC, At any rate, it would only be eight years afterwards that the Court en banc unanimously resolved the jurisprudential conundrum through its declaration in <i>Land Bank v. Martinez</i> that the better rule was that enunciated in <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i>, The Court must, therefore, prospectively apply <i>Philippine Veterans Bank</i>. The effect is that the petitioner's cause of action for the proper valuation of her expropriated property should be allowed to proceed. Hence, her complaint to recover just compensation was properly brought in the RTC as the SAC, whose dismissal of it upon the motion of Land Bank should be undone.<br><br><b>WHEREFORE</b>, we <b>GRANT</b> the petition for review on <i>certiorari</i>, and <b>REVERSE</b> the decision of the Court of Appeals dated November 22, 2002; and <b>DIRECT</b> the Regional Trial Court, Branch 30, in Dumaguete City to resume the proceedings in Civil Case No. 12558 for the determination of just compensation of petitioner Jocelyn S.

But while the <i>ponencia</i> is of the position that the rulings in <i>Republic</i> and <i>Suntay</i> have already been superseded, I respectfully submit that the doctrine is as valid and applicable now as it were before.<br><br>The issue in the case at bar originated from the petition of Jocelyn S. Limkaichong (Limkaichong) for the determination of the amount of just compensation that she is entitled to under the CARL, Pursuant to Sec. 16 of the law, the Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) "<i>shall conduct summary administrative proceedings to determine the compensation for the land</i>"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[3]</sup> if the landowner rejects the initial offer of compensation from the government; and "<i>[a]ny party who disagrees with the decision may bring the matter to the court of proper jurisdiction for final determination of just compensation</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[4]</sup><br><br>None of the parties doubts that the proper court in this case is the RTC in Dumaguete City designated as the SAC. Respondents postulate, however, that the judicial remedy is subject to a 15-day reglementary period reckoned from the date of receipt of the DAR's valuation, citing Sec. 54 of the CARL, as well as Sec. 11, Rule XIII of the 1994 DARAB Rules. The rule provides:<br><blockquote>Sec.11 <i>Land Valuation and Preliminary Determination and Payment of Just Compensation</i>. - The decision of the Adjudicator on land valuation and preliminary determination of just compensation shall not be appealable to the Board but shall be brought directly to the Regional Trial Courts designated as Special Agrarian Courts within fifteen (15) days from receipt of the notice thereof. Any party shall be entitled to only one motion for reconsideration.<br></blockquote>Replicated in Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 DARAB Rules is the imposition of the 15-day reglementary period. The provision reads:<br><blockquote>Sec. 6. Filing of Original Action with the Special Agrarian Court for Final Determination. - The party who disagrees with the decision of the Board/Adjudicator may contest the same by filing an original action with the Special Agrarian Court (SAC) having jurisdiction over the subject property <b>within fifteen (15) days from his receipt</b> of the Board/Adjudicator's decision, (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>Since it was not disputed herein, as it was in fact admitted, that petitioner Limkaichong availed of the judicial remedy after about two-and-a-half months had elapsed from receipt of notice, respondents claim that the SAC ought to have dismissed her petition outright.<br><br>Respondents' argument fails to persuade.<br><br><center><b>Discussion</b><br></center><br><b><i>The determination of just compensation is a judicial function</i></b><br><br>The payment of just compensation is a constitutional limitation to the government's exercise of eminent domain. Despite making numerous appearances in various provisions of the fundamental law,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup> it was the understanding among the members of the Constitutional Commission that the concept of "just compensation" would nevertheless bear the same jurisprudentially-settled meaning throughout the document.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup><br><br>As settled, the term "just compensation" refers to the full and fair equivalent of the property taken from its owner by the expropriator, The measure is not the taker's gain, but the owner's loss. The word "just" is used to qualify the meaning of the word "compensation" and to convey thereby the idea that the amount to be tendered for the property to be taken shall be real, substantial, full and ample.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup><br><br>The determination of just compensation is essentially a judicial function, consistent with the Court's roles as the guardian of the fundamental rights guaranteed by the due process and equal protection clauses, and as the final arbiter over transgressions committed against constitutional rights.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> This was the teaching in the landmark <i>Export Processing Zone Authority v. Dulay (Dulay)</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> wherein the Court held that:<br><blockquote>The determination of "just compensation" in eminent domain cases is a judicial function. <b>The executive department or the legislature may make the initial determinations <u>but</u></b> when a party claims a violation of the guarantee in the Bill of Rights that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation, <b>no statute, decree, or executive order can mandate that its own determination shall prevail over the court's findings. Much less can the courts be precluded from looking into the "just-ness" of the decreed compensation</b>. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote><i>Dulay</i> involved an expropriation case for the establishment of an export processing zone. There, the Court declared provisions of Presidential Decree Nos. 76, 464, 794, and 1533 as unconstitutional for encroaching on the prerogative of the judiciary to determine the amount of just compensation to which the affected landowners were entitled. The Court further held that, at the most, the valuation in the decrees may only serve as guiding principles or factors in determining just compensation, but it may not substitute the court's own judgment as to what amount should be awarded and how to arrive at such amount.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br><br>The seminal case of <i>Dulay</i> paved the way for similar Court pronouncements in other expropriation proceedings. Thus, in <i>National Power Corporation v. Zabala</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> as in the catena of cases that preceded it,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> the Court refused to apply Sec. 3-A of Republic Act No. 6395, as amended,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[13]</sup> in determining the amount of just compensation to which the landowner therein was entitled. As held:<br><blockquote>xxx The payment of just compensation for private property taken for public use is guaranteed no less by our Constitution and is included in the Bill of Rights. <b>As such, no legislative enactments or executive issuances can prevent the courts from determining whether the right of the property owners to just compensation has been violated. It is a judicial function that cannot "be usurped by any other branch or official of the government."</b> Thus, we have consistently ruled that statutes and executive issuances fixing or providing for the method of computing just compensation are not binding on courts and, at best, are treated as mere guidelines in ascertaining the amount thereof.<br></blockquote>To reiterate, the concept of just compensation is uniform across all forms of exercise of eminent domain. There is then neither rhyme nor reason to treat agrarian reform cases differently insofar as the determination of just compensation is concerned. I therefore express my concurrence to the line of cases that ruled that the land valuation by DAR is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party, for, in the end, the courts still have the right to review with finality the determination in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[14]</sup><br><br><b><i>The jurisdiction of the SAC is original and exclusive</i></b><br><br>Congress bestowed on the SACs "original and exclusive jurisdiction" over petitions for the determination of just compensation relating to government-taking of properties under the CARL. This could not be any clearer from the language of Sec. 57 of the law, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction</i>.</b> — The Special Agrarian Courts shall have <b>original and exclusive jurisdiction</b> over all petitions for the <b>determination of just compensation to landowners</b>, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>The fundamental tenet is that jurisdiction can only be granted through legislative enactments,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[15]</sup> and once conferred cannot be diminished by the executive branch. It can neither be expanded nor restricted by executive issuances in the guise of law enforcement. Thus, although the DAR has the authority to promulgate its own. rules of procedure,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[16]</sup> it cannot modify the "original and exclusive jurisdiction" to settle the issue of just compensation accorded the SACs. Stated in the alternative, the DAR is precluded from vesting upon itself the power to determine the amount of just compensation to which a landowner is entitled.<br><br>This further finds support under Sec. 18 of the CARL, to wit:<br><blockquote><b>Section 18. <i>Valuation and Mode of Compensation</i>.</b> — The LBP shall compensate the landowner in such amounts as may be agreed upon by the landowner and the DAR and the LBP, in accordance with the criteria provided for in Sections 16 and 17, and other pertinent provisions hereof, <b>or as may be finally determined by the court</b>, as the just compensation for the land. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>As can be gleaned, the CARL contemplates of only two modes of fixing the proper amount of just compensation: either by agreement of the parties, or by court ruling. Should the parties then fail to agree, the only remaining option is to seek court intervention. Notably, the law does not leave to any other body, not even the DAR, the final determination of just compensation. The jurisdiction of the SAC on this matter, therefore, remains to be original and exclusive.<br><br>This is consistent with the oft-cited ruling that the taking of property under RA 6657 is an exercise of the power of eminent domain by the State, and that the valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[17]</sup> As held in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[18]</sup><br><blockquote>It is clear from Sec. 57 that the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners. <b>This original and exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC would be undermined if the DAR would vest in administrative officials original jurisdiction in compensation cases and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions.</b> Thus, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from Sec. 57 that the original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. <b>Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Sec. 57 and therefore would be void.</b> Thus, direct resort to the SAC by private respondent is valid. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>The Court has applied this holding in numerous other cases. <i>Heirs of Vidad v. Land Bank of the Philippines</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[19]</sup> (<i>Heirs of Vidad</i>) summarized the Court's jurisprudence on this point thusly:<br><blockquote>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Wycoco</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[20]</sup> the Court upheld the RTCs jurisdiction over Wycoco's petition for determination of just compensation <b>even where no summary administrative proceedings was held before the DARAB</b> which has primary jurisdiction over the determination of land valuation. xxx<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Court of Appeals</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[21]</sup> the landowner filed an action for determination of just compensation <b>without waiting for the completion of DARAB's re-evaluation of the land</b>. xxx<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Natividad</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[22]</sup> wherein Land Bank questioned the alleged <b>failure of private respondents to seek reconsideration of the DAR's valuation</b>, but instead filed a petition to fix just compensation with the RTC xxx.<br><br>In <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Celada</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[23]</sup> where the issue was whether the SAC erred in assuming jurisdiction over respondent's petition for determination of just compensation <b>despite the pendency of the administrative proceedings before the DARAB</b> xxx. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>In the cases cited in <i>Heirs of Vidad</i>, the Court has invariably upheld the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs over petitions for the determination of just compensation, notwithstanding the seeming failure to exhaust administrative remedies before the DAR.<br><br>More recently, in <i>Land Bank of the Philippines v. Montalvan</i>,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[24]</sup> therein petitioner argued that the landowner's filing with the SAC of a separate complaint for the determination of just compensation was premature because the revaluation proceedings in the DAR were still pending. The Court ruled, however, that the pendency of the DAR proceedings could not have ousted the SAC from its original and exclusive jurisdiction over the petition for judicial determination of just compensation since "<i>the function of fixing the award of just compensation is properly lodged with the trial court and is not an administrative undertaking</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[25]</sup><br><br>Direct resort to the SAC is, therefore, valid. The Court never considered the issuance of a prior DAR valuation as neither a jurisdictional requirement nor a condition precedent, and in its absence, as a fatal defect.<br><br><b><i>Allowing the DAR valuation to attain finality diminishes the jurisdiction of the SAC</i></b><br><br>The dictum allowing the valuation by the DAR to attain finality if not brought before the SAC within 15 days is inconsistent with the above disquisitions. The DAR's valuation, being preliminary in nature, could not attain finality, as it is only the courts that can resolve the issue on just compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[26]</sup> Administrative rules that impose a reglementary period for filing a petition before the SAC, consequently allowing the DAR's preliminary valuation to attain finality, unduly diminish the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SAC, and convert it into an appellate one.<br><br>To clarify, the doctrine of "finality of judgment" is reserved only to those rendered by judicial or quasi-judicial bodies in the valid exercise of their jurisdiction. Dispositions of judicial and quasi-judicial bodies on matters within their jurisdiction or competence to decide are valid and binding,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[27]</sup> On the other hand, a judgment issued without jurisdiction is no judgment at all and cannot attain finality no matter how long a period has elapsed.<br><br>The imposition of the 15-day reglementary period ought to then be construed as a claim of jurisdiction. By decreeing that its valuation is capable of attaining finality, the DAR effectively arrogated unto itself the power to make a final determination, a binding judgment, on the amount of just compensation the landowner is entitled to, a power expressly bestowed exclusively upon the courts under Secs. 18 and 57 of the CARL. Consequently, it rendered the proceedings before the SACs appellate in nature, rather than originally commenced thereon.<br><br>Moreover, it contravened the Court's doctrine in the landmark case of <i>Dulay</i> wherein we held that the judicial branch can never be barred from resolving the issue of just compensation. Apropos herein is a reproduction of the Court's holding in <i>Dulay</i>:<br><blockquote>The determination of "just compensation" in eminent domain cases is a <b>judicial function</b>. <b>The executive department or the legislature may make the initial determinations but</b> when a party claims a violation of the guarantee in the Bill of Rights that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation, <b>no statute, decree, or executive order can mandate that its own determination shall prevail over the court's findings. Much less can the courts be precluded from looking into the "just-ness" of the decreed compensation.</b> (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>The Court's pronouncement in <i>Republic</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> should, therefore, be upheld. There, the landowner filed a petition for the determination of just compensation before the SAC beyond the reglementary period mandated by the DAR rules. Nevertheless, the Court held that the outright dismissal of the case was not warranted. Instead, it endeavored to preserve the original and exclusive jurisdiction of the SACs in the following wise:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup><br><blockquote>In accordance with [the procedure for the determination of compensation cases under R.A. No. 6657], the private respondent's case was properly brought by it in the RTC, and it was error for the latter court to have dismissed the case. In the terminology of [Sec.] 57 [of the CARL], the RTC, sitting as a Special Agrarian Court, has original and exclusive jurisdiction over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners. <b>It would subvert this original and exclusive jurisdiction of the RTC for the DAR to vest original jurisdiction in compensation cases in administrative officials and make the RTC an appellate court for the review of administrative decisions.</b><br><br>Consequently, although the new rules speak of directly appealing the decision of adjudicators to the RTCs sitting as Special Agrarian Courts, it is clear from [Sec.] 57 that the <u>original</u> and <u>exclusive</u> jurisdiction to determine such cases is in the RTCs. <b>Any effort to transfer such jurisdiction to the adjudicators and to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to [Sec] 57 and therefore would be void. What adjudicators are empowered to do is only to determine in a preliminary manner the reasonable compensation to be paid to landowners, leaving to the courts the ultimate power to decide this question.</b> (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>Invoking this doctrine, the Court, in <i>Suntay</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[30]</sup> emphasized that the petition before the SAC is an original action, and not an appeal. It echoed that "<i>[a]ny effort xxx to convert the original jurisdiction of the RTCs into appellate jurisdiction would be contrary to Section 57 and therefore would be void</i>."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[31]</sup> Resultantly, the Court ruled that the filing of the petition beyond the 15-day period in that case did not bar the SAC from exercising its original and exclusive jurisdiction in resolving the issue of just compensation.<br><br>In line with this ruling, the Court resolved in <i>Heirs of Vidad</i><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[32]</sup> that:<br><blockquote>xxx RA 6657 does not make DARs valuation absolutely binding as the amount payable by LBP. A reading of Section 18 of RA 6657 shows that the courts, and not the DAR, make the final determination of just compensation. <b>It is well-settled that the DAR's land valuation is only preliminary and is not, by any means, final and conclusive upon the landowner or any other interested party.</b> The courts will still have the right to review with finality the determination in the exercise of what is admittedly a judicial function. (emphasis added)<br></blockquote>All told, the DAR's valuation cannot be treated as the amount of just compensation the landowner is entitled to, notwithstanding the lapse of 15 days from receipt of notice thereof. It is not in the nature of an award that was "finally determined by the court," for, aside from the DAR not being a court of law, the postulation would render the subsequent petition before the SAC an appeal. This would, in turn, contravene the clear and categorical tenor of the law that the jurisdiction of the SAC, with respect to the issue of just compensation, is <b>original and exclusive</b>.<br><br><b><i>The 15-day reglementary period has no statutory basis</i></b><br><br>The inapplicability of the 15-day reglementary period is further bolstered by Sec. 16 of the CARL, which outlined the procedure for the acquisition of private lands under the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[33]</sup> While the provision states that the party who disagrees with the valuation by the DAR may bring the issue to court,<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[34]</sup> the law is silent as to the period for doing so.<br><br>It is plain error for respondents to claim that the 15-day period finds basis under Sec. 54 of the CARL, which pertinently reads:<br><blockquote><b>Section 54. <i>Certiorari</i>.</b> — Any decision, order, award or ruling of the DAR on any agrarian dispute or on any matter pertaining to the application, implementation, enforcement, or interpretation of this Act and other pertinent laws on agrarian reform may be brought to the Court of Appeals by certiorari except as otherwise provided in this Act within fifteen (15) days from the receipt of a copy thereof.<br></blockquote>The title of the provision itself evinces that the period only applies to <i>certiorari</i> petitions before the Court of Appeals (CA) for purposes of reviewing DAR rulings falling within its jurisdiction. It serves to distinguish petitions for <i>certiorari</i> under the CARL from those filed under the Rules of Court, which are allowed a 60-day leeway for filing.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[35]</sup><br><br>Moreover, any party desiring to appeal a ruling to the CA or to this Court is mandated to do so within fifteen (15) days, as provided under Sec. 60 the CARL.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[36]</sup> Thus, if Congress intended for the same period to likewise apply to the filing of petitions for the determination of just compensation before the SAC, reckoned from the date of notice from the DAR ruling, then the law would have expressly provided the same.<br><br>Succinctly put, there is no basis for requiring the petition for the determination of just compensation to be filed within 15 days from receipt of notice of the DAR's valuation. The validity of Sec. 11, Rule XIII of the 1994 Rules, as reincarnated in Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 Rules, cannot then be sustained and, instead, must be struck down as void and of no legal effect.<br><br>Aside from lacking statutory basis, the imposition of the 15-day reglementary period likewise unduly diminishes the jurisdiction vested on the SACs, as earlier discussed. Guilty of reiteration, the duty to fix just compensation is a judicial function, and the jurisdiction of the SACs to set the appropriate value for it is original and exclusive. This is the clear import of Sec. 57 of the CARL. These cardinal doctrines, however, are violated by the imposition of a 15-day reglementary period under Sec. 11, Rule XIII of the 1994 Rules of Procedure and Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 Rules of Procedure. These rules supplement the perceived silence of the CARL with a provision that contradicts Sec. 57 thereof—vesting the DAR with the authority to render a binding judgment on the valuation of the subject property, and converting the original action before the SAC into an appellate one.<br><br>It is settled jurisprudence that a rule or regulation cannot offend or collide with a legal provision. In cases of conflict between the law and the rules and regulations implementing the same, the law must always prevail.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[37]</sup> The Court said as much in <i>Miners Association of the Philippines, Inc. v. Factoran</i>:<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[38]</sup><br><blockquote>We reiterate the principle that the power of administrative officials to promulgate rules and regulations in the implementation of a statute is necessarily limited only to carrying into effect what is provided in the legislative enactment. The principle was enunciated as early as 1908 in the case of <i>United States v. Barrias</i>, The scope of the exercise of such rule-making power was clearly expressed in the case of <i>United States v. Tupasi Molina</i>, decided in 1914, thus: "Of course, the <b>regulations adopted under legislative authority by a particular department must be in harmony with the provisions of the law</b>, and for the sole purpose of carrying into effect its general provisions. <b>By such regulations, of course, the law itself cannot be extended.</b> So long, however, as the regulations relate solely to carrying into effect its general provisions. By such regulations, of course, the law itself cannot be extended. So long, however, as the regulations relate solely to carrying into effect the provision of the law, they are valid." (emphasis added, citations omitted)<br></blockquote>The spring cannot rise higher than its source. And just as a statute cannot be at variance with the Constitution, so too must the implementing rules conform to the language of the law.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> Rules and regulations cannot go beyond the terms and provisions of the basic law they seek to implement. The power to promulgate Rules and Regulations cannot be extended to amending or expanding the statutory requirements or to embrace matters not covered by the statute. Rules that subvert the statute cannot be sanctioned.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>Such being the case, Sec. 11, Rule XIII of the 1994 Rules of Procedure and Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 Rules of Procedure are null and void and of no legal effect. There is no period expressly nor impliedly prescribed by RA 6657 within which landowners may bring an action with the SAC for the determination of the just value of their lots.<br><br>Nevertheless, the government, in the interim, is not precluded from proceeding to take the property in issue, provided that the necessary deposit has been made. Thus, while landowners may take their sweet time to institute the said case, the fact that the DAR will proceed to cancel the title of lot owners and replace the same with a Certificate of Land Ownership is more than ample reason for them to file the case with the SAC posthaste. The expropriation process is then, in a manner of speaking, self-policing since the landowners are compelled to litigate and file a case for just compensation if they are unsatisfied with the government's deposit. The inapplicability of the 15-day reglementary period is, therefore, of no moment.<br><br>In view of the foregoing, I respectfully register my vote to GRANT the instant petition, The 15-day requirement under Sec, 11, Rule XIII of the 1994 DARAB Rules of Procedure and Sec. 6, Rule XIX of the 2009 DARAB Rules of Procedure should be declared NULL and VOID and of no legal effect for being contrary to Sec. 57 of the CARL.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.

The most relevant portion of this procedure is paragraph (f), which states that "[a]ny party who disagrees with the decision may bring the matter to the court of proper jurisdiction for final determination of just compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[5]</sup><br><br>On the jurisdiction over petitions for the determination of just compensation, Section 57 of Republic Act No, 6657 provides:<br><blockquote>SECTION 57. <i>Special Jurisdiction</i>. — The Special Agrarian Courts shall have <i>original and exclusive jurisdiction</i> over all <b><i>petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners</i></b>, and the prosecution of all criminal offenses under this Act. The Rules of Court shall apply to all proceedings before the Special Agrarian Courts, unless modified by this Act.<br><br>The Special Agrarian Courts shall decide all appropriate cases under their special jurisdiction within thirty (30) days from submission of the case for decision. (Emphasis supplied)<br></blockquote>Thus, Regional Trial Courts sitting as Special Agrarian Courts have "<b><i>original and exclusive jurisdiction</i></b> over all petitions for the determination of just compensation to landowners."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[6]</sup> The jurisdiction is <i>original</i>, which means that petitions for determination of just compensation may be initiated before Special Agrarian Courts. The jurisdiction is <i>exclusive</i>, which means that no other court or quasi-administrative tribunal has the same original jurisdiction over these cases.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[7]</sup> There are no ambiguities in Section 57. No administrative process can subvert this grant of original and exclusive jurisdiction to Special Agrarian Courts.<br><br>The right to just compensation is constitutionally enshrined. Article III, Section 9 of the Constitution states that "[p]rivate property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[8]</sup> Article XIII, Section 4<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[9]</sup> of the Constitution also recognizes the landowner's right to just compensation. As a constitutional right, the determination of just compensation is ultimately a judicial matter. Thus, in <i>Export Processing Zone Authority</i>:<br><blockquote>The determination of "just compensation" in eminent domain cases is a judicial function. The executive department or the legislature may make the initial determinations but when a party claims a violation of the guarantee in the Bill of Rights that private property may not be taken for public use without just compensation, no statute, decree, or executive order can mandate that its own determination shall prevail over the court's findings. Much less can the courts be precluded from looking into the "just-ness" of the decreed compensation.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[10]</sup><br></blockquote>Section 57, which vests in the courts original and exclusive jurisdiction to determine just compensation, is consistent with the Constitution.<br><br>Although Section 54 of Republic Act No. 6657 states that "[a]ny decision, order, award or ruling of the D[epartment] [of] A[grarian] R[eform] on any agrarian dispute or on any matter pertaining to the application, implementation, enforcement, or interpretation of this Act . . . may be brought to the Court of Appeals by <i>certiorari</i>,"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[11]</sup> this must be read in relation to Section 57.<br><br>Section 54 generally covers all decisions, orders, awards, or rulings of the Department of Agrarian Reform. On the other hand, Section 57 is a more specific provision that expressly vests special jurisdiction over the determination of just compensation in Special Agrarian Courts.<br><br>Further, agrarian dispute under Section 3 is defined as follows:<br><blockquote>SECTION 3.

The conflict between landowners and government, in instances of expropriation, is not included.<br><br>Although "any controversy relating to compensation of lands acquired under this Act"<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[12]</sup> is an agrarian dispute under Section 3, paragraph 2 of Republic Act No. 6657, this cannot encompass just compensation for a landowner. This contemplation would be in direct conflict with the unambiguous text of Section 57, as well as the constitutional right to just compensation.<br><br>Moreover, there are two (2) types of compensation that may take place under agrarian reform. The first is the just compensation that must be paid by government upon condemnation, or the taking of land from a landowner.

The valuation of property or determination of just compensation in eminent domain proceedings is essentially a judicial function which is vested with the courts and not with administrative agencies. When the parties cannot agree on the amount of just compensation, only the exercise of judicial power can settle the dispute with binding effect on the winning and losing parties, On the other hand, the determination of just compensation in the RARAD/DARAB requires the voluntary agreement of the parties. Unless the parties agree, there is no settlement of the dispute before the RARAD/DARAB, <b>except if the aggrieved party fails to file a petition for just compensation <u>on time</u> before the RTC</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[28]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis and underscoring supplied.)<br></blockquote>Neither landowner nor agency can disregard the administrative process provided under RA 6657 without offending the constitutional prerogative of the Congress to grant primary jurisdiction to the DAR.<br><blockquote>xxx [I]n cases raising issues of fact not within the conventional experience of judges or cases requiring the exercise of administrative discretion, agencies created by Congress for regulating the subject matter should not be passed over. This is so even though the facts after they have been appraised by specialized competence serve as a premise for legal consequences to be judicially defined. <b>Uniformity and consistency in the regulation of business entrusted to a particular agency are secured, and the limited functions of review by the judiciary are more rationally exercised, by preliminary resort for ascertaining and interpreting the circumstances underlying legal issues to agencies that are better equipped than courts by specialization, by insight gained through experience, and by more flexible procedure.</b><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[29]</sup> (Emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>The adjudication by the DAR on just compensation is not an executive recommendation or a superfluity to be blithely dismissed by the courts.

It is oppressive to the landowner, to the DAR and the Land Bank of the Philippines (LBP) because it violates the Constitution's command that "[a]ll persons shall have the right to a <i>speedy</i> disposition of their cases before all judicial, quasi-judicial, or administrative bodies."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[39]</sup> It also defeats the primordial objective of the Revised Rules of Court "of securing a just, <i>speedy</i> and inexpensive disposition of every action and proceeding."<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[40]</sup><br><br>A thirty-year period will also impermissibly erode the "justness" of the just compensation inasmuch as just compensation requires that the payment be made <b>closest to</b> the taking:<br><blockquote><b>The concept of just compensation embraces</b> not only the correct determination of the amount to be paid to the owners of the land, but also <b>the payment of the land within a reasonable time from its taking</b>. Without prompt payment, <b>compensation cannot be considered "just" inasmuch as the property owner is being made</b> to suffer the consequences of being immediately deprived of his land while being made <b>to wait for a decade or more before actually receiving the amount necessary to cope with his loss</b>.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[41]</sup> (Citations omitted, emphasis supplied.)<br></blockquote>Finally, the constitutional guarantee of equal protection of the laws demands that a thirty-year period should be available to both the landowner and the DAR/LBP. Under this regime, landowners would be tempted to speculate on receiving interest if they postpone the filing of the action to determine just compensation, thus, shifting the burden of the risk of inflation to the Government. This, in turn, will disturb the Government's budget process and consequently increase the cost to be incurred by the Government in implementing land reform, Conversely, unscrupulous DAR/LBP functionaries may be tempted to unduly delay appeal for corrupt reasons. This will leave a landowner uncertain, for the duration of the thirty-year period, as to the true value of his property, the very evil he is sought to be protected from by <i>Martinez</i>:<br><blockquote>xxx This rule is not only in accord with law and settled jurisprudence but also with the principles of justice and equity. Verily, a belated petition before the SAC, <i>e.g.</i>, one filed a month, or a year, or even a decade after the land valuation of the DAR adjudicator, must not leave the dispossessed landowner in a state of uncertainty as to the true value of his property.<sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[42]</sup><br></blockquote>I vote to <b>GRANT</b> the petition.<br><br><hr width="60%" size="1" noshade align="LEFT"><sup style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">[1]</sup> G.R.
