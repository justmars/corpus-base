    \ Rizal, Felix Kho *alias* Co Cam, Sun Leo, Choa Eng Kuan and Amado M. Apostol\
    \ were charged with having allowed or procured the removal from the Felix Cigar\
    \ and Cigarettes Factory of cigaretters which were subject to specific tax in\
    \ the amount of P2,014.05 without paying said tax, because the stamps affixed\
    \ to said cigarettes were fake, false and counterfeit. After trial, Felix Kho,\
    \ Sun Leo and Amado M. Apostol were acquitted upon the theory that Choa Eng Kuan,\
    \ the factory manager, had exclusive control of the Felix Cigar & Cigarettes Factory\
    \ and, if any offense was committed, said factory manager was responsible therefor;\
    \ and upon the finding that \"there is not iota of evidence to show that the President\
    \ and members of the Board of Directors conspired with the factory manager in\
    \ the commission of the alleged offense, much less was evidence presented to show\
    \ that the President and directors had knowledge of the commission of the act\
    \ complained. Subsequently, in criminal case No. 4264 of the Court of First Instance\
    \ of Rizal, Felix Kho, Sun Leo, Choa Eng Kuan and Amado M. Apostol were charged\
    \ with having had in their possession and control in the Felix Cigar & Cigarettes\
    \ Factory false and counterfeit internal revenue stamps for the purpose of using\
    \ them to evade the payment of specific taxes amounting to P24,312.25, in violation\
    \ of section 170 of the National Internal Revenue Code. Felix Kho, Sun Leo and\
    \ Amado M. Apostol filed a motion to quash, alleging that in criminal case No.\
    \ 4253, it was already shown that the factory manager Choa Eng Kuan had full supervision\
    \ and control of the operations of the Felix Cigar & Cigarettes Factory, without\
    \ any knowledge or participation on the part of movants; and that if there was\
    \ any responsibility for any offense in connection with said operations, it was\
    \ solely in the factory manager, the accused Choa Eng Kuan. The court issued an\
    \ order dated October 27, 1953, dismissing the case against Felix Kho, Sun Leo\
    \ and Amado M. Apostol, with their proportionate shares of the costs *de oficio*.\
    \ From this order the prosecution has appealed.\n\n In the appealed order the\
    \ lower court stated that \"Although the ground for the motion to quash in this\
    \ case is not couched exactly in the language of the second clause of Section\
    \ 10 of Rules 113 of the Rules of Court, yet, after a careful scrutiny of all\
    \ the allegations contained in said motion it is apparent that the same is the\
    \ ground relied upon by the defense.\" Inasmuch as section 10 of Rule 113 speaks\
    \ of previous acquittal or jeopardy, there can be no doubt that the lower court\
    \ in essence and effect had ruled that the acquittal of Felix Kho, Sun Leo and\
    \ Amado M. Apostol in criminal case No. 4253, is a bar to the present prosecution.\n\
    \n It is elementary that the plea of previous conviction will prosper only if\
    \ the former prosecution is for the same offense, or for an attempt to commit\
    \ the same or frustration thereof, or for any offense which necessarily includes\
    \ or is necessarily included in the offense charged in the former complaint or\
    \ information (section 9, Rule 113, Rules of Court).\n\n It is quite clear that\
    \ the offense charged in the present case, namely, possession of counterfeit internal\
    \ revenue stamps for the purpose of using them, punished under section 170 of\
    \ the National Internal Revenue Code, is distinct and different from the offense\
    \ charged in the information in criminal case No. 4253, namely, allowing or procuring\
    \ the removal of cigarettes subject to specific tax without paying said tax, punished\
    \ under section 174 of the National Internal Revenue Code.\n\n But it is contended\
    \ that if anybody is responsible for or guilty of the possession of the counterfeit\
    \ internal revenue stamps in question, it is solely the factory manager Choa Eng\
    \ Kuan who, upon his plea of guilty, was already convicted by the lower court\
    \ in this case and sentenced to pay a fine of P1,000, with subsidiary imprisonment\
    \ in case of insolvency, plus one-fourth of the costs. This would be good as a\
    \ matter of defense on the part of the defendants-appellees, Felix Kho, Sun Leo\
    \ and Amado M. Apostol, on which, however, they are necessarily required to present\
    \ corresponding proof. It should be remembered that the acquittal of said appellees\
    \ in criminal case No. 4253 was based on the very finding of the lower court that\
    \ there was not an iota of evidence to show that they conspired with the factory\
    \ manager in the commission of the offense charged therein, namely, allowing or\
    \ procuring the removal of cigarettes with fake or counterfeit internal revenue\
    \ stamps, and that there was no evidence to show that they had knowledge of the\
    \ commission of said offense. Without the appellees having presented any evidence\
    \ in the present case as to their lack of participation in or knowledge of the\
    \ possession of the counterfeit internal revenue stamps, it cannot be assumed\
    \ that, as in the other criminal case, No. 4253, they did not conspire with the\
    \ factory manager or had no knowledge of the existence in the Felix Cigar & Cigarettes\
    \ Factory of the counterfeit internal revenue stamps in question.\n\n Appellees'\
    \ argument that the appeal taken by the prosecution in this case would place the\
    \ appellees in jeopardy for a second time is clearly untenable, because an amended\
    \ information was filed by the fiscal and there is nothing in the record to show\
    \ that arraignment has been made thereunder. It is noteworthy that it was said\
    \ amended information which the appellees moved to quash.\n\nWherefore, the appealed\
    \ order is hereby reversed, and the case remanded to the Court of First Instance\
    \ of Rizal for further proceedings. So ordered without costs. *Bengzon, Padilla,\
    \ Montemayor, Jugo, Reyes, A., Bautista Angelo*, and"
